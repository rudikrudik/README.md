- 🔭 My Quick Story
<br/>
=====================
<br/>
My first coding experience was at middle school when I joined Turuncu Maker Lab we learned basic Algorithm(Scratch), Electronics(Breadboard) with Ardiuno later on I joined the FRC team İTOBOT 6038 as a programmer we coded in Python(OpenCV) and Java(wpilib) year after that I became the Programming Lead then found and became the Strategy Lead I also able to give a Python workshop when I was 16 along side beign the Co-Pilot of the robot that year! ✨ 
<br/>
I wasn't convinced that I was ready for job applications thats why I joined Bilge Adam Akademi C# .NET/.NET Core Bootcamp to further advance myself in the Backend Software Development field!
